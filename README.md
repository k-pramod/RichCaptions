# RichCaptions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p13i/rich-captions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/p13i/rich-captions)

_Symbolic math/science captions for educational videos_

**Live project**: http://apps.pramodk.net:8001/

## Problem identified:

- Online education solutions are rapidly gaining popularity and institutional adoption
- Existing video captioning systems are limited to displaying simple plain-text messages
- Math/science students learn better by reading semantically-useful symbols as found in text books

## Solution created:

- Created web application where content creators can easily caption their videos in LaTeX, the most popular tool for typesetting math and science textbooks and academic papers
- Allows anyone on the internet to watch these captioned videos without cost

## Screenshot

Below, you can compare the status-quo (plain-text) captions to the richer ones provided by this service:
